Interfaces:

* Interfaces are the Abstract  in it allthe methods are abstract methods but without using abstract keyword.

* Interfaces are Implemented but not inherited like in abstract classes.it uses keyword implements to class to implement the methods of Interfaces.
    for Ex: class my implements Clothes{
    }

* We cannot have object have a Interface but can have reference of interfaces.

* Interface methods are to overridden same like abstract classes because all the interfaces methods are abstract.

* It can achieve Dynamic Method Dispatch and Multiple Polymorphism. therefore it is runtime polymorphism.
