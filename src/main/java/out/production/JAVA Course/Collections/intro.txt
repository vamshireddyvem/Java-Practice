collections are a framework that provides a set of classes and interfaces for storing and manipulating groups of objects efficiently. The Java Collections Framework (JCF) was introduced in JDK 1.2 and includes various data structures like lists, sets, queues, and maps.

Key Components of Java Collections:
- Interfaces – Define the abstract data types (e.g., List, Set, Queue, Map).
- Classes – Concrete implementations of these interfaces (e.g., ArrayList, HashSet, LinkedList, HashMap).
- Algorithms – Utility methods for sorting, searching, and modifying collections (Collections.sort(), Collections.reverse()).

Common Collection Types:
- List (ArrayList, LinkedList, Vector) – Ordered collection that allows duplicates.
- Set (HashSet, TreeSet, LinkedHashSet) – Unordered collection that does not allow duplicates.
- Queue (PriorityQueue, ArrayDeque) – Follows FIFO (First-In-First-Out) order.
- Map (HashMap, TreeMap, LinkedHashMap) – Stores key-value pairs.
