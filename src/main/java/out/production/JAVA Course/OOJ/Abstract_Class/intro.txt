There are Two Types of Classes

Abstract ( to make a class Abstract : use keyword Abstract before class.)

abstract class Super {

}

Concrete (Class are regular Classes)

* We Can have both regular and  Abstract Methods in the Abstract  Classes.

* we cannot make abstract class or abstract method final. because, the abstract classes or methods are to be overridden.

* we cannot make abstract class or abstract method  Static. because the static methods has to have a body or definition.

* But In Concrete Class We cannot have a Abstract Method, If a method has to be Abstract the class also has to Abstract

* An Abstracted Method Doesn't have any definition. for ex: Abstract Void Display();

* We Cant Create Object of a Abstract Class but we Can have A reference

* If a Sub class is Inherited from Abstract Super Class the Sub class will also be Abstract Class unless the Abstracted Method is Over ridded.
